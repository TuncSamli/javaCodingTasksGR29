/*
Write a function:
that, given a positive integer N, prints the numbers_Print_consecutive_Numbers numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate
line. However, any numner divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should oe replaced ny the worn Codility, Test or
Coders respectively. If a number is divisible Dy more than one of the numbers: 2.3 or 5, it should
be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given
order. For example, numbers divisible by Doth 2 and 3 should be replace by CodilityTest and
numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2.3 and 5, shouIcl be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.

For ex.ample. here is the output for N â€” 24:

1
Codility
Test
Codility
 Coders
 CodilityTest
7
Codility

Codi1ityCoders
11
